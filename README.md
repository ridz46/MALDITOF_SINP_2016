# MALDITOF_SINP_2016
This repository includes all the codes written in R during my summer internship at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, under Dr. Soumen Kanti Manna. The codes process raw MALDI TOF data and creates 2D and 3D images of the MALDI plates, and also it reports the affect of normalization on the raw data.
